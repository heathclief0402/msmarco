# Submit to Document and Passage Ranking Leadboards

## Datasets

Please go to [https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/Datasets](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/Datasets) for all dataset descriptions and pointers.

## File format

For both tasks, please prepare the test results file in the following TAB-separated (TSV) format: qid\<TAB\>pid\<TAB\>rank.

We report MRR@10 for both tasks. Therefore, to minimize the size of your test results file, please free to only inclde the top 10 results per query.

## Evaluation script

The official evaluation script for the two tasks are available at the below locations:
* Document ranking: <https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking/blob/main/ms_marco_eval.py>
* Passage ranking: <https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking/blob/master/ms_marco_eval.py>

## Submission process

Once you have built a model that meets your expectations on evaluation with the dev set, you can submit your test results to get official evaluation on the test set.
To ensure the integrity of the official test results, we do not release the correct answers for test set to the public.

To submit your model for official evaluation on the test set, follow the steps corresponding to the appropriate task:

### Document ranking

For the document ranking task, we follow a GitHub pull request based submission process.
Please find the submission guidelines for the document ranking task here: <https://microsoft.github.io/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking-Submissions/>.

### Passage ranking

For the passage ranking task, we follow a GitHub pull request based submission process.
Please find the submission guidelines for the passage ranking task here: <https://microsoft.github.io/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking-Submissions/>.

<!---
For the passage ranking task, we will move to a GitHub pull request based submission process in the near future.
But currently, please generate your results file for the Dev and Test sets, and then submit the following information by [email](mailto:ms-marco@microsoft.com?subject=MS%20Marco%20Submission).
* Individual/Team Name: Name of the individual or the team to appear in the leaderboard [Required]
* Individual/Team Institution: Name of the institution of the individual or the team to appear in the leaderboard [Optional]
* Model information: Name of the model/technique to appear in the leaderboard [Required]
* Paper Information: Name, Citation, URL of the paper if model is from a published work to appear in the leaderboard [Optional]
* Code Information: A github repo of your model, instruction of how to use, etc [Optional]

To encourage reproducibility of results we encourage all teams to submit their code along with documentation and hyperparameters used.

The Test set is meant to be a blind set.
We want to discourage modeling decisions based Test numbers to avoid overfitting to the set.
To ensure this, we request participants to submit:

1. No more than 2 runs in any given period of 30 days.
2. No more than 1 run with very small changes, such as different random seeds or different hyper-parameters (e.g., small changes in number of layers or number of training epochs).

Participants who may want to run ablation studies on their models are encouraged to do so on the dev set, but not on the Test set.
